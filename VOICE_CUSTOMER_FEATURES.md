# Voice Customer Management Features

## Overview
Added comprehensive voice commands for customer management to the POS system. Staff can now add customers to the CRM using natural voice commands.

## Voice Commands Supported

### Basic Customer Addition
- "add customer John Smith phone 9876543210"
- "register customer Mary Johnson phone 9876543210 email mary@gmail.com"
- "create customer David phone 9123456789"
- "new customer Sarah email sarah@example.com phone 9988776655"

### Voice Command Patterns
The system supports flexible voice patterns:
- **Name**: Any combination of first and last names
- **Phone**: 10-digit Indian format numbers (automatically extracted)
- **Email**: Standard email format (optional)
- **Keywords**: add/register/create/new + customer

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Voice Service Updates
- **VoiceCommand Interface**: Added `CUSTOMER` type with fields:
  - `customerName?: string`

  - `customerEmail?: string`
  - `customerAddress?: string`

### 2. AI Processing (Groq API)
- Enhanced system prompt with customer command examples
- Intelligent parsing of name, phone, and email from voice input
- Fallback regex parsing for robust extraction

### 3. Command Dispatching
- **VoiceContext**: Added `executeCustomerCommand()` function
- **Event System**: Uses `voiceCustomerCommand` custom events
- **Global Listening**: Both Tables and TakeOrder components handle customer commands

### 4. Customer Service Integration
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically checks for existing customers by phone

## Deployment Notes

### Requirements
- Voice recognition support (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Microphone permissions
- Active internet connection for AI processing
- Firebase Firestore access
- **Groq API Key** for advanced voice AI features

### API Key Setup
To enable advanced voice AI features and audio transcription:

1. **Get a free Groq API key**:
   - Visit https://groq.com/
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Generate an API key from your dashboard

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Add `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here` to your environment
   - For development: Create `.env.local` file in project root
   - For production: Set environment variable in your hosting platform

3. **Verify configuration**:
   - Restart your development server
   - Voice commands will show enhanced AI processing
   - Without API key, system falls back to basic pattern matching

### Environment Variables Template
```env
# Required for advanced voice AI features
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Other configuration variables
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
# ... other Firebase config
```

### Security Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit API keys to version control**
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file
- ‚úÖ Use different API keys for development and production

### Performance Considerations
- Duplicate checking adds ~200ms to customer creation
- Voice processing typically completes in 1-3 seconds
- Network-dependent for AI command analysis
- Local fallback parsing for offline scenarios

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions
2. **Commands not recognized**: Speak clearly, retry command
3. **Duplicate errors**: Check existing customer database
4. **Network issues**: Voice commands require internet connectivity

### Debug Information
- All voice commands logged to browser console
- Customer creation attempts tracked
- Error details available in console logs
- Toast messages provide real-time feedback
